# Hyde
An app that allows native-ish (iOS and Android) management of a Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub Pages.

Initially it will just be for management of a single site (savesnine.store) so there will be some assumptions around the post format. In the future I would like to make it more generalised so that any standard-ish Jekyll site could be managed by Hyde.
